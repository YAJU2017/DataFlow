# Rift Framework
_An ETL Framework based on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) for Data engineers._

## Overview
This is a project I have been working on for a few months, 
with the purpose of allowing Data engineers to write efficient, 
clean and bug-free data processing projects with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

The main objective of this Framework is to make the engineer mainly focus on writing the 
**Transformation** logic of large scale ETL projects, rather than writing the entire application layout over and over, 
by providing only the necessary information for input data sources extraction and output data persistence. 

## Context & Requirements
_Under Construction._

## Getting Started & Documentation
The Rift Framework maintains reference documentation 
Github [wiki pages](https://github.com/vbounyasit/Rift-ETL/wiki), and will have a 
better support later on as the website construction progresses.
