# Rift ETL
_An ETL Framework in Scala for Data engineers._

## Overview
This is a project I have been working on for a few months, 
with the purpose of allowing Data engineers to write efficient, 
clean and bug-free data processing projects with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

The main objective of this Framework is to make the engineer mainly focus on writing the 
**Transformation** logic of large scale ETL projects, rather than writing the entire application over and over, 
by providing only the necessary information for input data sources extraction and output data persistence.
